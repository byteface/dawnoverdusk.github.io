<!-- TO DO: Add in nicer svg files to represent LinkedIn, CV and Email, the images being same colour as font. Will upload into folder. Perhaps hovering over them will provide a tooltip as to what they are (document svg > View My CV). Got to fix Email so it does the thing that prompts you to open email or whatever.-->
